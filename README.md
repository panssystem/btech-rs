Inspired by the [BattleTech Universe](https://bg.battletech.com/universe/) and [MegaMek](https://megamek.org), but frustrated by the resource requirements and network and Java difficulties of the latter, I set out to see how hard it would be to implement a web front end for MegaMek. This quickly changed into a project to re-implement the BattleTech rules in Rust.

## Status: Early Alpha

This project probably doesn't even qualify as Early Alpha. Reimplementing MegaMek (and maybe in the future [MekWars]) is a **huge** endeavor.

The plan is to use MegaMek data files, even if it's just to convert to another format.
